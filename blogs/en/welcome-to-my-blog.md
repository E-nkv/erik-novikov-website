First of all.. WELCOME ! 🤓

## What is this blog about?
Throughout this blog I intend on writing about tech - fullstack web-dev, programming, career advice, linux, cloud computing, AI, and software development in general. Occasionally I may write about other topics I find interesting, only if I'm absolutely sure it would be of help to you somehow. 

## A bit about me

Hey there! I'm Erik, a fullstack software dev. I started programming with 17 years old, went to university (Software Engineering), and after that I have been professionally in the industry for a bit over 2 years now. It's been an exciting ride, where I've had to learn A LOT, and will continue to do so. imo, that's the best thing about tech - it evolves all the time. Other than doing "normal dev stuff", I'm currently sharpening my cloud-computing (mostly AWS), 3D development, and AI skills. In my free time, you will find me building some cool software, doing sports, and sometimes playing a Dota2 match 🤓.

## Why this blog?

When I started immersing into tech, I found a lot of good and bad resources. Lots of them were completely useless, despite most being "correct" from a technical standpoint. Sometimes I felt extremely frustrated, not knowing where and how to learn stuff (let alone that tech influencers only confuse you even more). Whenever I would start learning via some book, course, YouTube video or blog, something deep down always asked me: "Are you sure this is the best way to use your time when trying to learn this topic?". And the true answer always was - **"I don't know, probably not"**. And it's obvious: how are you supposed to know if you have neither the knowledge nor the experience? Well, that brings us to why I started this blog:

1. It would be great if I could help you save at least a bit of all that time, effort and frustration in tech.
2. Writing about tech topics gives me a deeper understanding of them. It's Feynman's principle - to truly grasp something, I gotta be able to teach it well (or at least condense it's essence into simple words), or else I don't truly understand it.
3. **I just enjoy it 🙂**

## About my writing style

- **I don't like fluff**. 
- **I keep it casual**. I genuienly believe that day to day language helps you learn the concepts much better, even at the price of being "slighly unaccurate from a technical perspective"
- **It is value driven**. I only post something if I believe it will be of GREAT VALUE to you, else I won't upload it. Just because it's free for you to consume, it doesn't mean I am allowed to post shitty content (this would make me a "shitty blogger", which I'm not 😅)

- **I won't use AI to write**: Yes, you heard it right. While I do use them to double check stuff like punctuation and spacing, I promise I won't be giving you the typical "AI-response-smelling-blog", which feels dry and AI-stenchy. That would neither satisfy me, nor help me to "trully grasp" what I'm writing about. Besides, I genuenly enjoy writing. It's like meditating, but with ones and zeros 🤓.
