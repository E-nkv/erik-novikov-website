If you know my writing style, you know I don't like fluff. I neither want to waste your time, nor provide you low-value content. No click-bait titles - if I name this blog "The ultimate developer guide in 2025", it's because I genuinely believe it is the ultimate guide for it.

## Who is this guide for? 
- The beginner looking to jump into the tech market
- The junior who feels stuck, not knowing what to learn or do next
- The senior who is looking for a refresh on his skills
- Literally anyone that had the luck to come across this blog 😅

## Intro
In this guide, I'll talk about the meta, soft and hard skills I believe you should have as a developer. Lots of skills are transferable across domains, both tech and non-tech related, though the hard skills focus mostly on web development (both backend and frontend). For the sake of conciseness, I have decided to split very long sections into separate blogs, so you get to choose whether you need or want to read more on any of them.


## Meta skills
- **English:** You already know this. It is no secret that the latest and best information is almost always in English, especially in tech, from documentation to interacting with co-workers. I suggest aiming for C1, or B2 as a minimum. For preparation, there are tons of youtube videos, blogs, and even web-based online platforms where almost for free you can get all the knowledge you need, which combined with tons of practice, will help you reach at least B2 in about 6 months. Then, try getting a certificate that is somewhat recognized, for example [***EFSET***](https://www.efset.org/), which is totally free and is actually a very good proxy for your English level.
- **How to learn effectively:** In tech, not only do you have to learn a lot of stuff, but you also have to keep up with the changes, and at an incredible pace at that. So it makes sense that you should train "the skill to learn" itself. For this, I highly suggest you read [***Scott Young's book Ultralearning***](https://google.com/Scott-Young-ultralearning). I have zero affiliation with him, and I genuinely consider it was a game changer with respect to how productive I became learning new skills and maintaining current ones. Or if you prefer my summary of it with what I found most productive and helpful, check out [***guide-on-ultralearning***](http://localhost:3000/blogs/guide-on-learning)
- **Searching effectively:** Whenever you have a bug, or trying to learn some topic, or literally searching for anything online, you may be the type of person that goes straight to GPT and asks the big (most times suboptimal and not-so-clear) prompt. Or you may google your way through it. Either way, you should know how to search effectively, since that will take up a considerable amount of your time as a developer and 21st century person.

- **Using your text editor effectively:** Development is not only coding. It's mostly thinking and figuring stuff out. But when you DO code, you should be able to do so super quick, without even having to think about it, to the point that it becomes second nature to you. Become confident in your ability to code **FAST**. This requires learning some shortcuts, and raw practice. Don't go to the extreme of learning 200 shortcuts (ESPECIALLY YOU, VIM USERS 🥸), just to realize that all that time, effort and mental space could have been better allocated to other stuff. Check out my [***guide-on-using-your-text-editor-effectively***](http://localhost:3000/blogs/guide-on-using-your-text-editor-effectively) where I guide you through how I use my text editor to reach, at least in my opinion, your peak development productivity and confidence using the text editor, in a practical way. I personally use vscode and cursor, but the guide will help you a lot regardless of which one you use.

## Soft skills
- **Effective communication:** As a developer and as a human in general, you should be able to communicate effectively. Both with tech and non-tech people, in multiple languages (if required). We as devs sometimes tend to disregard the importance of communication a lot, making lame excuses like 'hard skills are more important', or 'it's better to be as concise, logical and objective as possible, always'. Even I thought like that at one point, I have to admit 🥲. The thing is, that before being a developer, you are a human. This means to not be a jerk and be nice. Be kind to others, help them from time to time without expecting anything back, and learn how to interact socially, to properly understand others and make yourself understood. If you want to improve your communication skills, I suggest the following books: 
    - [***How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie***](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+Win+Friends+and+Influence+People+Dale+Carnegie+pdf) 
    - [***Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People by Vanessa Van Edwards***](https://www.google.com/search?q=Captivate+Vanessa+Van+Edwards+pdf) 
    - [***Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life by Marshall B. Rosenberg***](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nonviolent+Communication+Marshall+Rosenberg+pdf)

- **Open mindedness**: Never think you know everything, even in something you are extremely proficient in. Always accept other perspectives, be open and willing to view and do stuff differently. 

- **Mental strength, discipline, and work ethic:** If you are somewhat as passioned as me about tech and developing stuff, motivation and passion will help you a lot. However, not always you will feel like sitting down and putting in the long hours, and grind it out. When such times happen, you cannot rely on your passion for keeping you on track - only discipline and a strong work ethic will. Its about making a statement to yourself: when things become tough, do you want to be the one that gives up? Or do you want to achieve your goals and be responsible for your life? My suggestion for such times: do not think about it, JUST DO IT. Your future self will thank you for it, and deep down you will feel better, knowing that you did what you had to do and didn't give up. If you want to read more on this, I recommend the following: 
    - [***12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson***](https://www.google.com/search?q=12+Rules+for+Life+Jordan+Peterson+pdf) 
    - [***Discipline Equals Freedom by Jocko Willink***](https://www.google.com/search?q=Discipline+Equals+Freedom+Jocko+Willink+pdf)


## Hard skills

- **Strong knowledge on programming languages**: Become competent in at least two programming languages. I recommend one high level language (Javascript, Python, Java), and one low level (Go, Rust, C#). Understand the ins and outs of the language, it should become second nature to you doing stuff with it. Then take a look at the basics of other programming languages, just to get a feel of how stuff is done in them. For example, if your 'competent' programming language is Javascript, then take a look at how the same thing can be done in Python or Java. This will make you think more in terms of 'solving the problem' rather than 'trying to use techonology X to solve the problem'. Then, whats the difference between 'OK' and 'Strong' programming languages knowledge? Check out [Guide on programming languages](http//localhost:3000/blogs/guide-on-programming-languages)
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: This might be a bit controversial, since some believe that DSA has nothing to do with what you will probably be doing in the 'real world'. And yes, it is true that with some very little DSA knowledge you can get around in tech (mostly in frontend roles). However, I am 100% sure that DSA is a must to become an effective problem solver in programming. Start from the basics (Big O Notation, Arrays, Linked Lists, Dynamic Arrays, Hashmaps, Sorting Algorithms, Binary Search), to more advanced stuff (Recursion, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming). During university, i was super passionate about Competitive Programming, which required tons of DSA, and from experience I can tell you that this improved 10X my problem solving skills, not only in programming, but in tech in general.
