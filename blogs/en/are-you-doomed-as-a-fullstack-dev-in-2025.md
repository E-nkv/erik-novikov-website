# Are you doomed?

Is the future of software grim? Layoffs, a flood of newcomers, and AI everywhere. Are you actually doomed?

## Short answer

No. Tech evolves fast—and that’s good. Opportunity expands as software touches every field. The cost to learn is at an all‑time low. If you lean in, you win.

## But isn’t the market tougher?

Yes. Supply and demand apply. The fix is to differentiate on three levers:

1. Problem‑solving > trivia
    - It’s not how much you know—it’s how efficiently you use it.
    - Strong fundamentals (languages, networking, protocols: REST/SOAP/RPC/WebSockets/WebRTC, concurrency) let you adapt quickly.
2. AI fluency
    - Use modern LLMs and agents to multiply output.
    - Learn prompting, fine‑tuning, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate tools into your workflow.
3. Learning speed
    - Your edge is how fast you can learn, retain, and apply. Build the muscle with tight feedback loops and deliberate practice.

## Final words

You’re not doomed. The market is hard—good. Become extremely competent. Focus on problems, not tools. Learn continuously. Have fun and enjoy the journey.
