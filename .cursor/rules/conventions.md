Conventions

TypeScript

- Explicit types for exported functions, components, and APIs
- Avoid any and unsafe casts; prefer precise types
- Use early returns; avoid deep nesting

Naming

- Descriptive, readable names (no 1â€“2 letter identifiers)
- Functions: verbs; variables: nouns

Formatting

- Match existing project style
- Tailwind-first styling; keep class names readable and grouped logically

Content

- All posts must include canonicalId and language-specific slug
- Use ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD)

Testing/Validation

- Validate frontmatter on load (basic shape checks)
- Defensive code around missing translations
